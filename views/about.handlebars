<h1>About Page</h1>

<p class="subhead">Our hope is that this project helps park rangers and staff to find those stories, <br>
and to clearly show how people are enjoying parks across California.</p>

<article class="about-this-page">
  <h3>Why</h3>
  <p>Stories pour out of our parks every day. This project is a first step towards aggregating <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com">Instagram</a> &amp; <a href="http://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> content using the actual boundaries of our parks, so we can start to reveal how people feel about their favorite open spaces. </p>
  <p>Today, there's no easy way to see these stories in one place, especially for staff who are often under pressure to show that their park is being used and enjoyed. </p>
  <p><em>If you work in a California park, this site is for you!</em></p>
  <h3>What </h3>
  <p><a href="http://parks.stamen.com">parks.stamen.com</a> is primarily designed for people who work in parks. It's built on the idea that we can search for social media content that falls within a park's literal boundaries. By doing a precise geo-spatial search across the four web services we've selected for launch, we can look for content that was created within the parks themselves, which is pretty cool. We are also trying to introduce the idea of using the National Parks Service identifiers as "hashtags" so people can double down on marking their content in a specific park.</p>
  <p>The simple organizing principle looks something like this: <strong>California</strong> → <strong>Park Agency</strong> → <strong>Park</strong>. But, the fun part is -- we think -- that you can also move sideways in the hierarchy based on a simple "social media rank." So, for example, you can navigate across an ordered list of parks by acreage, by photo count, by tweet count, by checkins, or by some combination of those things. We've been trying to show what we all know to be true:  even very small parks can be interesting, or well-attended.</p>
  <p>You can also search for a park you know, or hit  <a href="#">random</a> up the top to find somewhere you've probably never seen before. (There are about 13,000 parks in California!)<br>
</p>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>There are a few different ways you can participate, depending on your point of view:</p>
<p>As a <em><strong>park administrator</strong></em>, you might like to teach your visitors that they can direct content to you, by using your park's hashtag. For example, if you take a photo in Yosemite, tag it with #YOSE, and parks.stamen.com will be able to find it. </p>
<p>You might like to use your park's hashtag on your marketing materials, or download the free park shape/outline to create new park schwag! Imagine a t-shirt or a sticker that has your park's outline and the hashtag on it!  We're hoping that this might be a way to help build community around individual parks. Just like people already purchase gear for their favorite sports team, why not buy a t-shirt to show that you love your favorite park?</p>
<p>If you're a <em><strong>park visitor</strong></em>, you can use a park's hashtag to place your content into the parks.stamen.com site, and help staff see how much you enjoyed your visit. It's really important for staff to demonstrate use of their parks, and this is a great way to do it!</p>
<h3>Who</h3>
<p>This project is a partnership between the Electric Roadrunner Foundation and <a href="http://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>. </p>
<p>In November 2013, we ran a workshop about the initiative with people from the <a href="http://parksconservancy.org/">Golden Gate Parks Conservancy</a>, <a href="http://www.nwf.org/">National Wildlife Federation</a>, <a href="http://www.ebparks.org/">East Bay Regional Park District</a>, <a href="http://www.openspacecouncil.org/">Bay Area Open Space Council</a>, <a href="http://www.sdbjrfoundation.org/">Stephen D. Bechtel Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.calparks.org/">California State Parks Foundation</a>, <a href="http://latinooutdoors.org/">Latino Outdoors</a> and the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/pore/index.htm">Point Reyes National Seashore</a>. It was a really informative day for us, as we listened and learned about how some of the folks who work in California's parks are using social media today. The fact that it's really hard for them to see how and when and who are using their parks was clear.</p>
<p>The site's structure rests on the shoulders of the <a href="http://www.calands.org/">California Protected Areas (CPAD)</a> database, so we'd like to say a big thank you to Larry Orman and his team over at <a href="http://www.greeninfo.org/">GreenInfo Network</a> for making it available to the world.</p>
<p>Thanks also to the <a href="http://www.aerospacemuseum.org/">San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum</a> for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/9373850726/">lovely photo of Yosemite</a> we used as our homepage backdrop, and <a href="http://thenounproject.com/jamison/">Jamison Wieser</a> from the Noun Project for our <a href="http://thenounproject.com/term/arrow/5438/">handsome arrow icon</a>. </p>
