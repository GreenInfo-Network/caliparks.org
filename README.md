Social media harvesters
=========
Mapping social media activity in parks and other open spaces in California.


This repository contains the Heroku-based node.js social media harvesters.

Most of this code has been copied over from the [local-harvester branch](https://github.com/stamen/parks.stamen.com/tree/local-harvester) of the repository.

These harvesters collect geotagged content from Flickr, Foursquare, and Instagram. (currently Twitter is handled using a separate codebase).


Testing locally
---------------

Run using Foreman. 

For example: `foreman run flickr`


About the algorithms
